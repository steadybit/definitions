== Experiment Tasks

=== recovery-of-single-container
The Kubernetes deployment recovers when a container is killed.
Use this to verify that restarts are possible. +
The affected pod should be replaced within a given time – ending with the Kubernetes deployment back in the ready state.

.*Parameters*
[%collapsible]
=====
|====
| environmentName     | The environment which is used for the experiment
| teamKey             | The team which is used for the experiment
| k8sClusterName      | The Kubernetes cluster of the container
| k8sNamespaceName    | The Kubernetes namespace of the container
| k8sDeploymentName   | The Kubernetes deployment of the container
| containerName       | The name of the container to kill
| maximumRecoveryTime | The maximum allowed recovery time (default: 2m)

=== recovery-of-single-host
Kubernetes deployment recovers when a host is shut down.
Use this to verify that deployments are host independent. +
The affected deployments' pods should be replaced within ten minutes – ending with the Kubernetes deployment back in the ready state.

.*Parameters*
[%collapsible]
=====
|====
| environmentName     | The environment which is used for the experiment
| teamKey             | The team which is used for the experiment
| k8sClusterName      | The Kubernetes cluster of the deployment
| k8sNamespaceName    | The Kubernetes namespace of the deployment
| k8sDeploymentName   | The Kubernetes Deployment, of which hosts a single one is rebooted.
| maximumRecoveryTime | The maximum allowed recovery time (default: 10m)

=== faultless-redundancy-container
Kubernetes deployment HTTP endpoint serves successful HTTP responses while a single container becomes temporarily unreachable.
Use this to verify a redundant deployment with readiness checks. +
It is recommended to check first for the weak spots `k8s-single-replica`, `k8s-readiness-probe`.
This task requires an exposed HTTP endpoint and at least two pod replicas.
A configurable HTTP call success rate is expected throughout.

.*Parameters*

=====
|====
| environmentName     | The environment which is used for the experiment
| teamKey             | The team which is used for the experiment
| k8sClusterName      | The Kubernetes cluster of the container
| k8sNamespaceName    | The Kubernetes namespace of the container
| k8sDeploymentName   | The Kubernetes deployment of the container
| containerName       | The name of the container to kill
| httpEndpoint        | The HTTP endpoint to perform GET requests on
| successRate         | The minimum required success rate. (default: 95)

=== faultless-redundancy-rolling-update
Kubernetes deployment serves successful HTTP responses while performing an update.
Use this to verify a rolling update strategy is implemented and functional. +
It is recommended to check first for the weak spots `k8s-deployment-strategy`.
This task requires an exposed HTTP endpoint and at least two pod replicas. A configurable HTTP call success rate is expected throughout.

.*Parameters*

| environmentName     | The environment which is used for the experiment
| teamKey             | The team which is used for the experiment
| k8sClusterName      | The Kubernetes cluster of the deployment
| k8sNamespaceName    | The Kubernetes namespace of the deployment
| k8sDeploymentName   | The Kubernetes deployment to roll over.
| httpEndpoint        | The HTTP endpoint to perform GET requests on
| successRate         | The minimum required success rate. (default: 95)

=== faultless-redundancy-host
Kubernetes deployment serves successful HTTP responses when a host is shut down.
Use this to verify that deployment's pods are spread across hosts.
It is recommended to check first for the weak spots `k8s-single-node`, `k8s-readiness-probe`. This task requires an exposed HTTP endpoint and at least two pod replicas. A configurable HTTP call success rate is expected throughout.
