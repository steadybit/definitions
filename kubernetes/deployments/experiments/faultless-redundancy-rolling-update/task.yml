type: experiment
description: >
  Kubernetes deployment serves successful HTTP responses while performing an update. 
  Use this to verify a rolling update strategy is implemented and functional.
  It is recommended to check first for the weak spots `k8s-deployment-strategy`.
  This task requires an exposed HTTP endpoint and at least two pod replicas. 
  A configurable HTTP call success rate is expected throughout.
