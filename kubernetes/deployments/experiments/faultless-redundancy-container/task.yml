type: experiment
description: >
  Kubernetes deployment HTTP endpoint serves successful HTTP responses while a single container becomes temporarily unreachable.
  Use this to verify a redundant deployment with readiness checks. 
  It is recommended to check first for the weak spots `k8s-single-replica`, `k8s-readiness-probe`. 
  This task requires an exposed HTTP endpoint and at least two pod replicas. 
  A configurable HTTP call success rate is expected throughout.
