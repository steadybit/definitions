type: experiment
description: >
  Check whether your redundancy to serve a HTTP endpoint works while a host is shutting down and your deployment's pods are spread across hosts.
  This task requires an exposed HTTP endpoint and at least two pod replicas, check the weak spots `k8s-single-node`, `k8s-readiness-probe`.

  - name: environmentName
