description: >
  Kubernetes deployment serves successful HTTP responses when a host is shut down.
  Use this to verify that deployment's pods are spread across hosts. 
  It is recommended to check first for the weak spots `k8s-single-node`, `k8s-readiness-probe`.
  This task requires an exposed HTTP endpoint and at least two pod replicas. 
  A configurable HTTP call success rate is expected throughout.
